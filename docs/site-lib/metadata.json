Strain is a representation of the physical and mental burden you take on as you travel the Monolith and fulfill your missions. While you have any amount of Strain, you are consider Strained. The maximum amount of Strain you can bear without faltering starts at 2 when you first Integrate this Aspect. Whenever you would end your turn with your Strain at its limit, you must make a Strain Shock Test:\nMake a Basic Test. On a Fail you gain the Shaken and Slowed conditions for 1 Round, and you then reduce your Strain by 1. If you would ever gain Strain while at your limit, you immediately make a Strain Shock Test instead.As you proceed through this Aspect you may find various means of using, gaining, and reducing Strain. To start, you gain the Bear the Burden and Lessen the Burden actions:\nBear the Burden | Reaction | 1 VP | Aspect, Guardian\nTRIGGER: An Ally within Near Range would Fail a Check.\nYou gain 1 Strain.

They built a civilization of magic and technology so grand that it was doomed to fall. Seven Ages of Humanity, Seven Collapses. The Last, knowing they were unable to resist the momentum of their forebears, devoted their great machinations to the construction of an edifice that would be able to destroy their own hubris and ambition, and thereby grant them their salvation.\nThe Monolith is all that lasts of their legacy, an ever-growing pillar of steel, silicon, and thread, watching over the broken remnants of their solar system. Inside, pockets of life carve out a myriad of imagined purposes amidst a chaotic web of colorful and sterile planes.&nbsp;\nAnother Pod awakens. A handful of synthetic life forms once created by the Monolith stir, known only as the Nameless. This may not be their first Cycle, and this may not be their last. They believe they know their mission, and they believe they know themselves.&nbsp;\nBut belief did not save Humanity.\nWelcome to the playtest for SENNOMA, a science-fiction+fantasy TTRPG about finding purpose and living life in a world that seems to have continued past death. In this game you and a group of fellow players will play as Nameless, synthetic lifeforms long ago created by the enigmatic and omnipotent machine god known as the Monolith, but now serving out your own eternal loops of sentience. Amidst the myriad Layers of the Monolith exist a thousand ecosystems and a million enclaves, varying from thick bioluminescent jungles to cities powered by steam. The Remnants, the parts of Humanity that stole away and continue to thrive within this metal being, form the bulk of the populace still alive within the various Layers. Alongside them are flora and fauna defying description, roaming the Monolith unchecked and unseen. Many elements of this system are loving homages or references to classic science fiction novels and manga, and it is in many ways intended to emulate the intricately awe-inspiring and ultimately-heroic elements of those journeys.SENNOMA as a game tries to highlight the key decision-making aspects and moment-to-moment gameplay of tactical TTRPGs, while keeping a clean, action-packed, and cinematic tone. It is powered by a d6 pool dice engine and a dual-skill check system that allows GMs to be more granular in the proficiencies they wish to test, as well as a Zone-based positioning system that removes the need for counting tiles while still allowing for dynamic action and tense decisions. The Nameless are eternal, but not immortal, and characters in this system leverage a multi-layered health and energy system that gives nuance and flavor to armored combat and the exhaustion that a conflict brings. The Nameless themselves will steadily grow their skills each session while periodically incorporating parts of modular class kits into their abilities, and will likewise build an arsenal of cinematic and self-created weapons and gear that are equally customizable. All of these rules serve to handle not only simple firefights and massive swarms, but any of the conflicts and challenges that the Nameless may face.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"project-sennoma.html","pathToRoot":".","attachments":[],"createdTime":1759008487809,"modifiedTime":1761823962171,"sourceSize":3214,"sourcePath":"PROJECT SENNOMA.md","exportPath":"project-sennoma.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":3,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"reference/actions/drop-item.html":{"title":"Drop Item","icon":"","description":"Type: Free | Cost: - |\nRequires: Held Item.Drop an item currently in your grasp, letting it fall to the ground wherever you are.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"reference/actions/drop-item.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761938416042,"modifiedTime":1761939101666,"sourceSize":194,"sourcePath":"Reference/Actions/Drop Item.md","exportPath":"reference/actions/drop-item.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":2,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"reference/actions/focus.html":{"title":"Focus","icon":"","description":"Type: Downtime | Cost: 1T | You shut out the world and focus inward, drawing upon the liberated powers that fuel your Soul.
