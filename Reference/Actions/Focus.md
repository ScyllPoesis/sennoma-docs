**Type:** Downtime | **Cost:** 1T | 

You shut out the world and focus inward, drawing upon the liberated powers that fuel your Soul. You are considered [[Unconscious]] during this period as your essence shifts and your abilities grow. You spend any amount of XP and SP on Affinities and Skills, and wake up with your newly-gained powers. 

If your Affinities changed, describe what visible effects they might present.
