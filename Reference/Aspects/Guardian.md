# Ability Tree

## **STARTING ABILITY: STRAIN**
Upon gaining this ability, add a mechanic called Strain to your character sheet with two checkboxes, representing your current and maximum Strain. Strain is a representation of the physical and mental burden you take on as you travel the Monolith and fulfill your missions. 

While you have any amount of Strain, you are consider Strained. The maximum amount of Strain you can bear without faltering starts at 2 when you first Integrate this Aspect. Whenever you would end your turn with your Strain at its limit, you must make a Strain Shock Test:
- Make a Basic Test. On a Fail you gain the Shaken and Slowed conditions for 1 Round, and you then reduce your Strain by 1. 

If you would ever gain Strain while at your limit, you immediately make a Strain Shock Test instead.

As you proceed through this Aspect you may find various means of using, gaining, and reducing Strain. To start, you gain the Bear the Burden and Lessen the Burden actions:

> Bear the Burden | Reaction | 1 VP | Aspect, Guardian
> TRIGGER: An Ally within Near Range would Fail a Check.
> You gain 1 Strain. Then, the target character may reroll the Check. This is a Rewind effect.

> Lessen the Burden | Downtime | 1 T | Aspect, Guardian
> You reduce your Strain by 1.
