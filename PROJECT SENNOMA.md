> Ten thousand years ago Humanity destroyed their Gods and scavenged their corpses for parts. They built a civilization of magic and technology so grand that it was doomed to fall. Seven Ages of Humanity, Seven Collapses. The Last, knowing they were unable to resist the momentum of their forebears, devoted their great machinations to the construction of an edifice that would be able to destroy their own hubris and ambition, and thereby grant them their salvation.
> 
> The Monolith is all that lasts of their legacy, an ever-growing pillar of steel, silicon, and thread, watching over the broken remnants of their solar system. Inside, pockets of life carve out a myriad of imagined purposes amidst a chaotic web of colorful and sterile planes. 
> 
> Another Pod awakens. A handful of synthetic life forms once created by the Monolith stir, known only as the Nameless. This may not be their first Cycle, and this may not be their last. They believe they know their mission, and they believe they know themselves.

> But belief did not save Humanity.

Welcome to the playtest for SENNOMA, a science-fiction+fantasy TTRPG about finding purpose and living life in a world that seems to have continued past death. 

In this game you and a group of fellow players will play as Nameless, synthetic lifeforms long ago created by the enigmatic and omnipotent machine god known as the Monolith, but now serving out your own eternal loops of sentience. Amidst the myriad Layers of the Monolith exist a thousand ecosystems and a million enclaves, varying from thick bioluminescent jungles to cities powered by steam. The Remnants, the parts of Humanity that stole away and continue to thrive within this metal being, form the bulk of the populace still alive within the various Layers. Alongside them are flora and fauna defying description, roaming the Monolith unchecked and unseen. 

Many elements of this system are loving homages or references to classic science fiction novels and manga, and it is in many ways intended to emulate the intricately awe-inspiring and ultimately-heroic elements of those journeys.

SENNOMA as a game tries to highlight the key decision-making aspects and moment-to-moment gameplay of tactical TTRPGs, while keeping a clean, action-packed, and cinematic tone. It is powered by a d6 pool dice engine and a dual-skill check system that allows GMs to be more granular in the proficiencies they wish to test, as well as a Zone-based positioning system that removes the need for counting tiles while still allowing for dynamic action and tense decisions. 

The Nameless are eternal, but not immortal, and characters in this system leverage a multi-layered health and energy system that gives nuance and flavor to armored combat and the exhaustion that a conflict brings. The Nameless themselves will steadily grow their skills each session while periodically incorporating parts of modular class kits into their abilities, and will likewise build an arsenal of cinematic and self-created weapons and gear that are equally customizable. All of these rules serve to handle not only simple firefights and massive swarms, but any of the conflicts and challenges that the Nameless may face.
